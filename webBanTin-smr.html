			<h2>OnePlus is officially part of the mainstream – with its partnership with T-Mobile and a promo campaign with Robert Downey Jr., the company wants its brand to be as recognizable as Apple or Samsung. That also means it’s not shy about the price.</h2>
			<p>At $700, the OnePlus 7 Pro matches the iPhone XS ($730) and Galaxy 10e ($750 MSRP, though you could easily find an S10 for that kind of cash). Long-time fans will likely scoff at that price, but they can look to the OnePlus 7 as an upgrade path. Indeed, the non-Pro won't even be available in the new hunting ground for OnePlus, the US.</p>
			<p>Americans can already buy the Pro (it launched on T-Mo this Friday), it’s available in India as well. Europeans will have to wait until next week. In China, it will start shipping this weekend. But who will buy one?</p>
			<p>Mobile photographers may be interested. With a 48MP main camera and 8MP telephoto (both with OIS), plus a 16MP ultra-wide cam, the OnePlus 7 Pro seems to have it all. That attention-grabbing pop-up camera doesn’t hurt either. It's not the best-quality camera (especially in low-light), but it gets close.</p>
			<p>Gamers might want to have a look too. This costs less than the Asus ROG phone, but delivers a better 90Hz AMOLED screen – QHD instead of 1080p. The Pro comes with the requisite Snapdragon 855 chipset, vapor chamber cooling, fast UFS 3.0 storage (the first phone in the world to do so) and as much RAM as you could possibly want.</p>
			<p>There’s a painful shortage of pure or nearly pure Android flagship out there. Yes, there are the Pixels, but those are quite expensive unless you’re in the US. Most Android One phones are mid-rangers. It doesn’t help that HMD hasn’t really managed to deliver a compelling Nokia flagship. Oxygen OS adds a few helpful features, but refrains from changing too much. And it has a solid track record when it comes to upgrades.</p>
			<p>Battery life is always a major consideration. In the tests for our review, we found that you might want to give up the 90Hz mode for the best endurance (92h in 60Hz mode, up from 85h). Of course, the new 30W Warp Charge makes this less of a concern as you can go from 0% to 50% charge in just half an hour.</p>
			<p>The OnePlus 7 Pro isn’t a fully-featured flagship – the company has traditionally omitted waterproofing, wireless charging and expandable storage, the 7 Pro is no exception. It does maintain its pricing edge over the likes of iPhone XS, Galaxy S10 and Huawei P30 Pro, so it’s okay not to have everything. Or is it?</p>

					<p><em>A lot can go wrong – Kerry Glen</em></p>
				</div>
				<div class="right">
					<p>Kerry Glen founded Ewaso River Honey in 1995, as more of a community project than a business, purchasing honey from people in northern Kenya. Glen says beekeepers are either unable to scale their operations or unwilling due to the costs of taking honey to market and the unpredictability of yields: “A lot can go wrong,” she says, using Kenya’s drought two years ago as an example.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Pesticide use on commercial farms is another problem. Hurters offers pollination services – another income stream for beekeepers – on litchi and orange farms in South Africa’s Mpumalanga province. “We go in with 2,000 hives. We come out with about 200,” says Jacques Hurter, the founder’s son and until recently, the CEO of Hurters. “It’s killing off the trade.” Ernest Simeoni, owner of Nairobi-based African Beekeepers, also tells me he’s lost a lot of bees to pesticide use in Kenya: “It’s a serious problem,” he stresses, adding that it’s the same story in Tanzania.</p>
			<p>Jacques Hurter left his CEO role last year to explore new ventures in Zambia and Malawi. His aim is to build a high-end Southern African honey brand. He has a site just outside Livingstone, Zambia, where he is setting up 1,000 Langstroth hives – the first of 200,000. There will be a processing plant at which outgrowers (contracted beekeepers) can drop off their honey, which Hurter will then buy and market. He will also provide training and funds for Kenyan top-bar hives, which are more commercial than the traditional bark hives.</p>
			<p>“If you want to do social upliftment, you need to be a partner in the business,” Hurter explains. This is where NGOs tend to fail. “In Zambia, that’s about helping the guys crop the proper quality – but then being the buyer as well. You give them the scope to expand, because you’ll pay them at the end of the day.”</p>
			<p>Then there’s a wave of new technology on the horizon to drive this traditional industry into the modern age. Terence Chambati, a Zimbabwean based in Uganda, identified the lack of data in the industry, when he couldn’t even find a reliable figure for how much honey Uganda was producing.</p>
			<p>He co-founded HuchiHive to start collating information and provide a tech-based approach to improve beekeeping. Their bee trackers – little “backpacks” for the bees – work out how far the bees are travelling and what they’re foraging, so farmers can plant the appropriate trees around their hives. Huchi smart-hives allow remote access to a beehive’s location, humidity, temperature, sounds and weight; the team are working on measuring pesticide residue, too. HuchiHive has just moved past the prototype stage and is now launching its pilot with 200 sites.</p>
			<p>This approach to data capture will be crucial to managing the industry going forward, promoting investment and measuring the gains of bee farming against potential problems, such as risks to wild pollinators.</p>
			<p>As conservation is challenged to become more profitable, well-managed bee farming in sub-Saharan Africa could become a pin-up for ethical industries – a business that protects a crucial pollinator, preserves forests, and provides sustainable income and business opportunities. A sweet deal, indeed.</p>
