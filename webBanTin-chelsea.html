			<h2>A Thai bay that was made famous by its appearance in the film The Beach is to remain closed until 2021.</h2>
			<p>Maya Bay, on the island of Phi Phi Leh, was temporarily closed last year after officials said a sharp rise in visitors had severely damaged the environment.</p>
			<p>Before it closed, up to 5,000 people were visiting the bay every day and most of its coral died as a result.</p>
			<p>Authorities have now extended the ban on visitors by two years to give more time for Maya Bay's ecology to recover.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Maya Bay: The beach nobody can touch</li>
				<li>Thailand's beach from The Beach closes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The beach featured prominently in the 2000 film of that name, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>
			<p>Since the bay closed last year, blacktip reef sharks have been sighted swimming in the waters of the bay.</p>
			<p>Local tourism operators have said they rely on the beach.</p>
			<p>The head of the local tourism association, Wattana Rerngsamut, told AFP that there should be public hearings "so that local people can earn a living".</p>
			<p class="text-bold">Bees can even be used to mitigate human-wildlife conflict.</p>
			<p>“Beehive fences” have been successful in places where elephants and humans co-exist. A study in Kenya headed by Lucy King of Save the Elephants looked at hives which are positioned around a field of crops. When an approaching elephant disturbs the hives, it aggravates the bees – which prompts a hasty retreat.</p>
			<p>In fact, King wrote, “80% of the elephants that approached the trial farms were kept out of the areas protected by the beehive fences.” A beekeeping villager not only benefits from honey and pollination services, but protection of their crops. And this, in turn, reduces retribution killings of wild animals. In addition, bee farming can provide a legal, stable and safe income alternative to wildlife poaching.</p>
			<p class="text-bold">Perfect solution?</p>
			<p>If beekeeping can protect honey bee populations, provide critical pollination services, help with wildlife restoration and protection and be a sustainable, lucrative business, it seems like the ideal eco-friendly industry.</p>
			<p>But many scientists have problems with the honey bee becoming a symbol of conservation.</p>
			<p>“I think it’s a bit of a red herring to claim that honey bees have potential for [global] conservation,” says Manu Saunders, a research fellow at the University of New England, Australia. “Wild pollinators [such as other bee species, flies, wasps, butterflies and moths] depend on the preservation of more diverse habitats than managed honey bees.”</p>
			
			<p>Jonas Geldmann of the University of Cambridge, co-author of a paper entitled Conserving honey bees does not help wildlife, says his concern is that managed honey bees compete with other pollinators, putting wild species at risk.</p>
			
			<p>But, Geldmann says, “this might be true of everywhere except Africa”. That is because African honey bees and South Africa’s Cape honey bees are native – unlike the honey bees in the Americas or Australia.</p>
			<p>“There’s an exchange between wild and managed bee populations,” explains Katherine Forsythe, a conservation biologist based in Cape Town. “You’re not introducing a species that will be in competition with other pollinators.”</p>
			<p>Geldmann suggests that, bearing in mind that “lack of natural habitat is the biggest problem to biodiversity”, in sub-Saharan Africa, “the risk to wild pollinators might be minimised by the benefit to ecosystems.”</p>
			<p>In addition to the environmental benefits, sub-Saharan Africa’s honey industry has potential for big economic returns. Typically, conservation and business do not go hand in hand. But that is changing: last year’s inaugural Business of Conservation Conference in Kigali, Rwanda, highlighted the urgent need for conservation to move from a series of philanthropic projects to an ethical, collaborative and business-minded industry.</p>
			<p>Beekeeping was cited as an example of a profitable conservation industry. But it must reach its full economic potential or there will not be a strong enough incentive for people to protect trees, for example, that might otherwise serve as charcoal or timber.</p>
			<p>The opportunity is there. “There’s a world shortage of honey – especially organic,” Smith notes. The price of honey is high, as is international demand: Europeans consume an average of 0.7kg (1.5lb) of honey per year, and the EU is the world’s biggest importer, buying in around 200,000 tonnes (it is also the second biggest producer of honey after China).</p>

					<p><em>Africa’s top honey-producing countries could earn an estimated $100 million (£76 million) per year with investment and innovation</em></p>
				</div>
				<div class="right">
					<p>Smith and Allsopp suggest Africa’s top honey-producing countries could earn an estimated $100 million (£76 million) per year with investment and innovation. Ethiopia – Africa’s biggest honey producer – currently makes 45,000 to 50,000 tonnes of honey a year, but a lot of that is used in local tej wine and less than 1,000 tonnes are exported. In Kenya, the National Farmers Information Service claims only 20% of the country’s honey-producing potential – estimated at 100,000 tonnes – is being tapped.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>One company that has taken advantage of demand for high-quality honey is Hurters Honey, a family business and one of South Africa’s most successful honey producers, founded in 1978. Surrounded by swathes of coastal fynbos vegetation with the Atlantic Ocean roaring beyond white sand dunes, Hurters has an enviable spot in Langebaan, 90 minutes outside Cape Town. Their hives yield deliciously fragrant fynbos honey – a specialist product sold by Hurters alongside eucalyptus and orange blossom honey.</p>
			<p>Hurters owes its success to having ownership of the entire supply chain and working closely with, training and investing in beekeepers – but few other companies have been as business-minded in their approach.</p>
			<p>Beekeeping in Africa is largely run by NGOs, which set up rural communities with basic equipment and then leave. There is not enough training and no access to market; within a couple of years, it’s common to find the equipment has been sold for cash or used as firewood.</p>
			<div class="text-phancach">

					<p><em>A lot can go wrong – Kerry Glen</em></p>
				</div>
				<div class="right">
					<p>Kerry Glen founded Ewaso River Honey in 1995, as more of a community project than a business, purchasing honey from people in northern Kenya. Glen says beekeepers are either unable to scale their operations or unwilling due to the costs of taking honey to market and the unpredictability of yields: “A lot can go wrong,” she says, using Kenya’s drought two years ago as an example.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Pesticide use on commercial farms is another problem. Hurters offers pollination services – another income stream for beekeepers – on litchi and orange farms in South Africa’s Mpumalanga province. “We go in with 2,000 hives. We come out with about 200,” says Jacques Hurter, the founder’s son and until recently, the CEO of Hurters. “It’s killing off the trade.” Ernest Simeoni, owner of Nairobi-based African Beekeepers, also tells me he’s lost a lot of bees to pesticide use in Kenya: “It’s a serious problem,” he stresses, adding that it’s the same story in Tanzania.</p>
			<p>Jacques Hurter left his CEO role last year to explore new ventures in Zambia and Malawi. His aim is to build a high-end Southern African honey brand. He has a site just outside Livingstone, Zambia, where he is setting up 1,000 Langstroth hives – the first of 200,000. There will be a processing plant at which outgrowers (contracted beekeepers) can drop off their honey, which Hurter will then buy and market. He will also provide training and funds for Kenyan top-bar hives, which are more commercial than the traditional bark hives.</p>
			<p>“If you want to do social upliftment, you need to be a partner in the business,” Hurter explains. This is where NGOs tend to fail. “In Zambia, that’s about helping the guys crop the proper quality – but then being the buyer as well. You give them the scope to expand, because you’ll pay them at the end of the day.”</p>
			<p>Then there’s a wave of new technology on the horizon to drive this traditional industry into the modern age. Terence Chambati, a Zimbabwean based in Uganda, identified the lack of data in the industry, when he couldn’t even find a reliable figure for how much honey Uganda was producing.</p>
			<p>He co-founded HuchiHive to start collating information and provide a tech-based approach to improve beekeeping. Their bee trackers – little “backpacks” for the bees – work out how far the bees are travelling and what they’re foraging, so farmers can plant the appropriate trees around their hives. Huchi smart-hives allow remote access to a beehive’s location, humidity, temperature, sounds and weight; the team are working on measuring pesticide residue, too. HuchiHive has just moved past the prototype stage and is now launching its pilot with 200 sites.</p>
			<p>This approach to data capture will be crucial to managing the industry going forward, promoting investment and measuring the gains of bee farming against potential problems, such as risks to wild pollinators.</p>
			<p>As conservation is challenged to become more profitable, well-managed bee farming in sub-Saharan Africa could become a pin-up for ethical industries – a business that protects a crucial pollinator, preserves forests, and provides sustainable income and business opportunities. A sweet deal, indeed.</p>
